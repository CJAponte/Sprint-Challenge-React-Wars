1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
        The main difference is that a Class component can hold state, data that can be changed and passed through to other components. Functional components pass props. Syntatically, we write Class components differently than Functional components as well - class components extend React.Component and utilize super() to access React's built in methods and functionality.

1.  Describe state.
        State is data held and passed into components, but it is mutable - it can be updated between renderings. State is created in a class component but can be passed and updated between parent and child.

1.  Describe props.
        Props are properties that are passed into functional components from a parent component and are immutable - the data shouldn't change.
